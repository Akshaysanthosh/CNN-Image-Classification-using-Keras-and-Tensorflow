<b>Python Jupyter Notebook with Convolutional Neural Network image classifier implemented in Keras . It's Google Colab ready.

Requirements

*Keras  2.x (TensorFlow as  backend)

*Python 3.x

For binary classifications you are good to go!

For non-binary classifications:

add other classes to training and validation directories
change class_mode from "binary" to "categorical"
change loss function from "binary_crossentropy" to "categorical_crossentropy"
